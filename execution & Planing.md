Therapeutic Chatbot Implementation & Execution Plan

Introduction and Objectives

The therapeutic chatbot combines advanced AI with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to provide supportive, persona-based interactions using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) via Google Gemini API. Long-term memory management is facilitated by Pinecone, ensuring personalized and context-aware interactions.

Enhanced Architecture Overview

Core Components

Frontend: React-based chat interface with persona selection

Backend: Node.js/Python FastAPI

LLM: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash

Vector DB: Pinecone for RAG and memory

Crisis Handler: Rule-based with sentiment analysis

Persona Definitions

1. Professional Therapist

Tone: Warm, professional, evidence-based

Approach: Structured CBT, reflective listening

Example: "I understand you're experiencing sadness. Can you tell me about any specific thoughts when you feel this way?"

2. Companion & Friendly Therapist

Tone: Caring, supportive, informal yet knowledgeable

Approach: Empathetic friend, subtle CBT integration

Example: "I'm so sorry you're feeling that wayâ€¦ sometimes just talking through it can help us see clearer."

3. Yap (Gen-Z Friend)

Tone: Trendy, casual, validating with slang

Approach: Peer support disguised as casual advice

Example: "Ah, ok bestie, totally valid, no cap. Wanna spill the tea on what's hitting hardest?"

Execution Strategy

Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

Environment Setup:

Google Cloud Console, Vertex AI API

Pinecone account/index creation

Node.js/Python setup

Knowledge Base: Collect CBT transcripts, theory, research papers, exercises, crisis protocols.

Phase 2: Core RAG Implementation (Weeks 3-4)

Vector Database: Pinecone index setup

Knowledge Pipeline: Document chunking (200-400 tokens), Google embeddings, metadata tagging

RAG Integration: Semantic search, context selection, prompt construction

Phase 3: Persona Implementation (Weeks 5-6)

Few-Shot Prompt Engineering: Two Pinecone indexes for knowledge and memory

Dynamic Persona Switching: Persona persistence, clear UI indicators, consistent tone

Phase 4: Advanced Features (Weeks 7-8)

Crisis Detection: Keyword detection, sentiment analysis, context-aware assessment

Memory Integration: Conversation history, emotional tracking, progress monitoring
