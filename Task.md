- **Generate tests** alongside main implementation code
- **Focus on working, tested code** over placeholder implementations

### Development Reminders
- Always test with real therapeutic scenarios
- Keep safety as the top priority  
- Focus on user experience over technical perfection
- Document any changes to core architecture
- Test persona consistency across multiple conversations

### Code Generation Standards
- Use async/await for all I/O operations
